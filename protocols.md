# Protocols

Rather than trying to fit all of the IoT Protocols on top of existing architecture models like OSI Model, we have broken the protocols into the following layers to provide some level of organization:

* **Infrastructure** (ex: 6LowPAN, IPv4/IPv6, RPL)
* **Identification** (ex: EPC, uCode, IPv6, URIs)
* **Comms / Transport** (ex: Wifi, Bluetooth, LPWAN)
* **Discovery** (ex: Physical Web, mDNS, DNS-SD)
* **Data Protocols** (ex: MQTT, CoAP, AMQP, Websocket, Node)
* **Device Management** (ex: TR-069, OMA-DM)
* **Semantic** (ex: JSON-LD, Web Thing Model)
* **Multi-layer Frameworks** (ex: Alljoyn, IoTivity, Weave, Homekit)

### Infrastructure


* **IPv6:** "IPv6, is an Internet Layer protocol for packet-switched internetworking and provides end-to-end datagram transmission across multiple IP networks.

* **6LoWPAN:** "6LoWPAN is an acronym of IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks. It is an adaption layer for IPv6 over IEEE802.15.4 links. This protocol operates only in the 2.4 GHz frequency range with 250 kbps transfer rate."

* **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** A simple OSI transport layer protocol for client/server network applications based on Internet Protocol (IP). UDP is the main alternative to TCP and one of the oldest network protocols in existence, introduced in 1980. UDP is often used in applications specially tuned for real-time performance.

* **QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections, pronounced quick):** supports a set of multiplexed connections between two endpoints over User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and was designed to provide security protection equivalent to TLS/SSL, along with reduced connection and transport latency, and bandwidth estimation in each direction to avoid congestion.

* **Aeron:** Efficient reliable UDP unicast, UDP multicast, and IPC message transport.

* **uIP:** The uIP is an open source TCP/IP stack capable of being used with tiny 8- and 16-bit microcontrollers. It was initially developed by Adam Dunkels of the "Networked Embedded Systems" group at the Swedish Institute of Computer Science, licensed under a BSD style license, and further developed by a wide group of developers.

* **DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer):** "The DTLS protocol provides communications privacy for datagram protocols. The protocol allows client/server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery. The DTLS protocol is based on the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and provides equivalent security guarantees."

* **ROLL / RPL:** (IPv6 routing for low power/lossy networks)

* **NanoIP:** NanoIP, which stands for the nano Internet Protocol, is a concept that was created to bring Internet-like networking services to embedded and sensor devices, without the overhead of TCP/IP. NanoIP was designed with minimal overheads, wireless networking, and local addressing in mind.

* **Content-Centric Networking (CCN):** Technical Overview
"Next-gen network architecture to solve challenges in content distribution scalability, mobility, and security.
CCN directly routes and delivers named pieces of content at the packet level of the network, enabling automatic and application-neutral caching in memory wherever itâ€™s located in the network. The result? Efficient and effective delivery of content wherever and whenever it is needed. Since the architecture enables these caching effects as an automatic side effect of packet delivery, memory can be used without building expensive application-level caching services."


* **Time Synchronized Mesh Protocol (TSMP):** A communications protocol for self-organizing networks of wireless devices called motes. TSMP devices stay synchronized to each other and communicate in timeslots, similar to other TDM (time-division multiplexing) systems.

This means LLAP can run over any communication medium. The three strengths of LLAP are, it'll run on anything now, anything in the future and it's easily understandable by humans.
