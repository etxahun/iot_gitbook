# CoAP


## Definition (Wikipedia)
---
**CoAP** is a software protocol intended to be used in very simple electronics devices, allowing them to communicate interactively over the Internet. It is particularly targeted for small, low-power sensors, switches, valves and similar components that need to be controlled or supervised remotely, through standard Internet networks. CoAP is an **application layer protocol** that is intended for use in resource-constrained internet devices, such as **WSN nodes**. CoAP is designed to easily translate to HTTP for simplified integration with the web, while also meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity. Multicast, low overhead, and simplicity are extremely important for Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) devices, which tend to be deeply embedded and have much less memory and power supply than traditional internet devices have. Therefore, efficiency is very important. CoAP can run on most devices that support UDP or a UDP analogue.

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Constrained RESTful environments (CoRE) Working Group has done the major standardization work for this protocol. In order to make the protocol suitable to IoT and M2M applications, various new functionalities have been added. The core of the protocol is specified in RFC 7252; important extensions are in various stages of the standardization process.
